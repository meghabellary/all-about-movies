# README
Application: AllAboutMovies
Heroku link:https://allaboutmovies.herokuapp.com/

A user can sign in or sign up to see a list of movies. Search	for a specific movie, go to a movie details page where they can play a trailer, can view the cast, plot and ratings from IMDB and rotten tomatoes ratings. I used an external API called OMDB to show the ratings. A user can add a review and rating to a movie. They can go to an actorâ€™s details page. A user can also maintain their favorites list. They can add a movie to their favorites list. On their favorites list they can remove a movie if they do not like it. I built all the internal API endpoints with Ruby on Rails. The frontend is built in React. I used PostgreSQL database to store the data.
